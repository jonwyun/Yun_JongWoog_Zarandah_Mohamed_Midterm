# Quatro Beverages
This project is about the rebranding of Quatro. New logo, flavour, and package design will be introduced in a new website.

## Quatro History
Quatro was a canned, fruit-flavoured carbonated drink produced from 1982 to 1989 in the United Kingdom. From 1983 to 1989 it was commonly available in the UK,[1] though production and sale of the drink ceased there in the mid-1980s.[citation needed] Green in colour, its name derived from the four fruits used: pineapple, orange, passion fruit and grapefruit.[1]

The current incarnation of the Quatro brand has been sold and marketed in South America by The Coca-Cola Company, since 1996. It is grapefruit-flavoured, and is sold in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay.
